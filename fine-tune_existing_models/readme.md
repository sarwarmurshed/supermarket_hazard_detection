### Description
---
 Fine-tune existing model using the MXNet framework. We have shared code to fine-tune six models in six different directories. The structures of all the directories are same. The following sections describes the necessary steps to fine-tune the GoogleNet model. Anyone can fine-tune other models by following the instructs of fine-tuning GoogleNet.

### Fine-tune models
---
1. It is recommended to use CUDA-compatible GPUs to train the model.
2. Download Grocery hazard dataset and put it into data folder. 
3. Follow notebook steps [fine_tune_with_test.ipynb](https://github.com/sarwarmurshed/supermarket_hazard_detection/blob/master/fine-tune_existing_models/fine-tune_googlenet/fine_tune_with_test.ipynb)
