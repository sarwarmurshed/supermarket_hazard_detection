### Description
---
 Fine-tune existing model using the MXNet framework. We have shared code to fine-tune six models in six different directories. The structures of all the directories are same. You just need to run the jupyter notebook to train a model. After training, a trained model will be saved in the model directory. This trained model will be used in the EasyDLROS framework.

### Fine-tune models
---
1. It is recommended to use CUDA-compatible GPUs to train the model.
2. Download Grocery hazard dataset and put it into data folder. 
3. Follow notebook steps [fine_tune_with_test.ipynb](https://github.com/sarwarmurshed/supermarket_hazard_detection/blob/master/fine-tune_existing_models/fine-tune_googlenet/fine_tune_with_test.ipynb)
